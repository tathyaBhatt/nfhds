Finally, one night before the big opening everything was finished!
CheeseCake! I was so tired my whole body ached even my fur! I thanked everyone in the office who had helped me. Then I dragged myself home.
But when I climed into my bed, I couldn't fall asleep. I kept thinking about the dragon exihibit.
Would the flyers look nice? What about the flowers?
Would there be enough food at the reception? I just couldn't stop worrying.
